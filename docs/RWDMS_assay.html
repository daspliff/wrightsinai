<p>In this document, we analyze the structure and contents of the <strong>RWDMS</strong> filesystem. We examine file sizes, file types, and the distribution of files across different directories. As part of this analysis, we also seek to identify any large files that are duplicated across multiple directories.</p>

<p>The data for this analysis was collected using a PowerShell script that recursively iterates through the RWDMS filesystem and outputs the directory structure and file information. The script (included below) generates a text file with the following columns: <em>Directory, Full Path, File Name, File Extension, File Size, Last Write Time, and File Owner</em>.</p>

<p>One obvious takeway from a cursory look at the raw dataset is the non-standardization of file names in the directories. For example, some directories use underscores to separate words, while others use spaces. Some directories use camel case, while others use all caps. Standardizing file names is an important practice in data science as it helps maintain consistency, organization, and ease of collaboration within a project or team.</p>

<section id="basic-structure-analysis" class="level1">
<h1>Basic Structure Analysis</h1>
<p>Lets start by looking at the number of files in each directory. Weâ€™ll use the <code>root_dir</code> column to group the data and then count the number of files in each group. Also, weâ€™ll remove the <code>tree</code> directory from the data since this was a directory we created to store the outputs generated from the powershell script. Weâ€™ll then arrange the data in descending order by the number of files in each directory and calculate the total size of each directory. Finally, weâ€™ll add two columns that calculates the fractional number of files in each directory, and the fractional size of each directory, respectively.</p>

<p><br> As we can see, the <code>HAPs data</code> directory contains the most files (specifically, 98% of all files), followed by the <code>CTSA</code> directory. However, the <code>Environmental_Data</code> directory , which accounts for only <em>0.6%</em> of the number of files contains the most data (53%). We can assume that is because the <code>Environmental_Data</code> directory contains a a smaller number of relatively large files, while the <code>HAPs data</code> directory contains many smaller files. Weâ€™ll explore this further in the next section.</p>
<p>Lets see what that looks like when we plot it. Weâ€™ll create a bar plot of the number of files in each directory. Because the data is very skewed, as shown in the table above, weâ€™ll log-transform the y-axis and sort the directories in descending order of total number of files.</p>

<h1>File Type Analysis</h1>
<p>Lets take a look at the distribution of file types in the RWDMS filesystem. Weâ€™ll start by tabulating the number of files of each file type. Weâ€™ll then calculate the total space occupied by each file type by summing across the size variable for each file type. Weâ€™ll also add a column that calculates the fractional number of files in each file type, and the fractional size of each file type, respectively. This summary table is displayed below.</p>

<h1>Checking for Duplicates</h1>
<p>Lets check to see if there are any files that are duplicated across multiple directories. Because we are interested in the duplication of large files, weâ€™ll filter the dataset for files greater than 100MB. Weâ€™ll start by creating a table of the number of files in each file name. Weâ€™ll then arrange the data in descending order by the number of files in each file name and calculate the total size of each file name. Weâ€™ll also add a column that calculates the fractional number of files in each file name, and the fractional size of each, respectively.</p>

<h1>File Inventory</h1>
<p>Lets create a searchble invetory of all the files in the RWDMS filesystem. Weâ€™ll start by creating a table of all the files in the RWDMS filesystem. We are especially interested in environmental datsets across the filesystem, so weâ€™ll filter for files with text-based (<code>.csv</code>, <code>.txt</code>, <code>.json</code>), binary (<code>.nc</code>, <code>.ncf</code>, <code>.hdf</code>, <code>.h5</code>), geospatial (<code>.tif</code>, <code>.tiff</code>, <code>.shp</code>, <code>.shx</code>, <code>.dbf</code>, <code>.kml</code>, <code>.kmz</code>, <code>.grib</code>, <code>.las</code>), database (<code>.sql</code>, <code>.sqlite</code>, <code>.db</code>, <code>.gdb</code>), and archive (<code>.zip</code>, <code>.rds</code>, <code>RData</code>) file extensions.</p>
